# ðŸŒŸComputer Vision with CIFAR-10 DatasetðŸŒŸ

This project focuses on implementing computer vision techniques using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal of this project is to train a model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Project Description

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using the torchvision library, which provides convenient functions to download and preprocess the dataset. The images are normalized and transformed to tensors for further processing.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture**: A CNN model is implemented using the PyTorch library. The model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The architecture is designed to extract meaningful features from the images and make accurate predictions.

3. **Model Training**: The CNN model is trained using the training dataset. The training process involves feeding batches of images to the model, calculating the loss, and optimizing the model parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent. The model is trained for multiple epochs to improve its performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated using the testing dataset. The trained model makes predictions on the test images, and the accuracy and loss are calculated to assess its performance. This step helps determine how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

5. **Visualization**: The project includes visualizations of the training and testing losses as well as the training and testing accuracies. These visualizations provide insights into the model's learning progress and performance.
